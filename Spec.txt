// Verified: matches implemented overlap logic (polygon fully inside -> polygon triangles; circle fully inside -> full circle primitive; intersection -> alternating lines and arcs, no consecutive arcs, arcs chosen by clockwise circle order and inside-polygon midpoints).
Unfortunately you're missing some circular sectors again. Think of it this way: The polygon will either be completely enclosed in the circle, in which case the algorithm should just trace the entire polygon as a single component
    as triangles in the order they occur in the polygon, or the circle is entirely enclosed in the polygon, in which case the overlap is just the circle (this is a special case where we can use a circle primitive instead of sector or triangle) or the polygon intersects
    the circle, in which case the boundary of the overlap will be a set of continuous chains of arcs and line segments such that there may be multiple consecutive line segments within a component but never multiple consecutive arcs (if a polygon vertex is only
    considered to intersect a circle if the incoming and outgoing edges are on different sides of the circle perimeter. There should always be a way to return to a chain of line segments via a clockwise journey around the circle to the next intersection between circle
    and polygon. This journey should eliminate parts of the the polygon that are interior to the circle until there are none left.
